## About the Game

This classic arcade game mutant is my 4th submission for the Udacity FEND Nandodegree course.

## Instructions

The player has to cross the road to access the river. His reasons are not part of our scope. Unluckily, the road is not only swarming with weird creatures, but there is not even a proper pedestrian crossing nearby. So our hero has to jaywalk, and you will help him in this!
You can control the player with the arrow keys. If you reach the river without collision, you WIN. If any of the monsters crashes into you, you are done :(

But worry not, you can go another round after, you just have to click!

Watch out. The furry monster is quite scary, and the big one which likes to cruise on the lane next to the river has already eaten another jaywalker earlier today! 

And you better be quick, the monsters are slowly getting quicker when the see you on the roadside.
